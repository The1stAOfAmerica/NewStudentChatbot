It is one of three high schools in the Pleasanton Unified School District, along with Foothill High School and Village High School. Founded as Amador Valley Joint Union High School (AVJUHS), it graduated its first class in 1923. Major construction and renovations were undertaken after district voters approved bonds in 1922, 1965, 1997, and 2016. The school is a four-time California Distinguished School and a three-time National Blue Ribbon School. In national competitions such as We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, the Amador Valley team has won the 1995 and 2022 national titles. The Amador Valley Wind Ensembles have performed at national venues and conferences, including Carnegie Hall and the Midwest Clinic. Several Amador Valley athletic teams have won multiple California Interscholastic Federation North Coast Section Division I titles since 2010, including the softball team which MaxPreps named 2014 mythical national champion following a perfect season.")
